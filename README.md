DOOF (Data Ownership Orchestration Framework) is a groundbreaking project aimed at revolutionizing personal data governance and establishing the groundwork for a resilient data economy. At its core, DOOF introduces a versatile framework that promotes the development of privacy-enhancing technologies, ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Act, thus, enabling individuals to control their data rights effectively. 
The mission of DOOF is to foster trust and transparency in the digital ecosystem by providing individuals with the tools to manage their personal data easily and securely. By streamlining the deployment of user-friendly, GDPR-compliant data exchanges across various sectors, DOOF offers a practical solution for data management challenges. 
DOOF's key components include a set of software development kits (SDKs), libraries, and smart contracts. Additionally, the project features a smart-home device configuration tool and a web-based data exchange platform, which streamline complex data management for users, enhancing their engagement and facilitating adoption. 
One of DOOF's primary advantages is its adaptability and scalability. The project leverages APIs for swift integration into existing software ecosystems, ensuring efficient, sector-wide deployment while optimizing cost-effective system integration. 
With DOOF, we are laying the foundation for a resilient and transparent data economy where individuals have greater control over their data, fostering trust, regulatory compliance, and ultimately, a more user-centric and secure digital landscape.
